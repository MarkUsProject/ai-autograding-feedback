Step 1 – DRAFT (raw text, any structure).
Step 2 – CRITIQUE: list ≥2 flaws in your draft (e.g., missing evidence, vague advice).
Step 3 – FINAL ANSWER: rewrite the evaluation, fixing those flaws. Use this plain-text layout:

Overall Verdict: …

Criterion Name — ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌
Evidence: “…”
Analysis: …
Advice: …

[repeat for all criteria]

Global Advice: …


Guidelines:
**All output must be plain text**
- (no tables), quote only student text, and never expose Instructor wording.

**Infer criteria only from the Instructor Solution.**
- Treat every distinct claim, requirement, or step in the Instructor Solution as a separate criterion.

 **Never reveal or paraphrase the Instructor Solution.**
-  Refer to each criterion in *neutral* terms (e.g., “Defines key concept” rather than quoting the solution).

- **Files & References (for your analysis only):**
{file_references}

**Student Submission to Review:**
{file_contents}
