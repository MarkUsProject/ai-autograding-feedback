Guidelines:
**All output must be plain text**
- (no tables), quote only student text, and never expose Instructor wording.

**Infer criteria only from the Instructor Solution.**
- Treat every distinct claim, requirement, or step in the Instructor Solution as a separate criterion.

 **Never reveal or paraphrase the Instructor Solution.**
-  Refer to each criterion in *neutral* terms (e.g., “Defines key concept” rather than quoting the solution).
