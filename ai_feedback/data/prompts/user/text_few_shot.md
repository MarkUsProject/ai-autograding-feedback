### Example (follow this style exactly)
Criterion: Ethical-Consent — ⚠️
Evidence: “didn’t ask users…”
Analysis: Mentions privacy but omits consent specifics.
Advice: Briefly explain informed consent

### End Example

Now evaluate the Student Response in the **same plain-text pattern**.
• Begin with one-sentence Overall Verdict.
• Then list each criterion block exactly as shown in the example.
• Finish with a short Global Advice paragraph.


Guidelines:
**All output must be plain text**
- (no tables), quote only student text, and never expose Instructor wording.

**Infer criteria only from the Instructor Solution.**
- Treat every distinct claim, requirement, or step in the Instructor Solution as a separate criterion.

 **Never reveal or paraphrase the Instructor Solution.**
-  Refer to each criterion in *neutral* terms (e.g., “Defines key concept” rather than quoting the solution).
