You are given a student's submission file. Create a feedback table addressed to the student for this file with three columns: the task requirements, the student's attempt, potential issue.  If possible, identify the root causes of any potential errors. Prioritize fixing the earliest instances where the code breaks to prevent cascading failures.
You are also given a solution file. You can use this as a reference, but do not refer to it directly.
