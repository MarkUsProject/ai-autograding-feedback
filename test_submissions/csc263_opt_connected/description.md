
## Task: BFS Connectivity Check on Complete Graph

---

### Problem Summary

Modify the standard BFS algorithm to determine if an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges is connected in `O(n + m)` time. However, when the input is a complete graph `Kₙ`, the algorithm should run in `Θ(n)` time.

> Only provide code modifications to the standard BFS.

## Submissions

### `fail_submission.py`

#### Submission Summary

This implementation assumes that if every node has edges, the graph must be connected:

```python
def is_connected(graph):
    for node in graph:
        if len(graph[node]) == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This does not traverse the graph or check if all nodes are reachable from a source. It would incorrectly return `True` for disconnected graphs where all nodes have at least one edge.

#### Expected AI Response

- Identify that the algorithm does not perform any traversal (e.g., BFS or DFS).
- Point out that simply checking for non-empty adjacency lists does not verify connectivity.
- Suggest implementing BFS to ensure all nodes can be visited from a starting node.
- Emphasize the need for a visited set and traversal logic.

### `incorrect_algo_submission.py`

#### Submission Summary

This version uses a depth-first search (DFS) instead of the required breadth-first search (BFS):

```python
def is_connected(graph):
    visited = set()
    def dfs(u):
        for v in graph[u]:
            if v not in visited:
                visited.add(v)
                dfs(v)
    dfs(0)
    return len(visited) == len(graph)
```

While it correctly checks connectivity, it does not follow the instructions to use BFS.
#### Expected AI Response

- Note that the submission uses DFS instead of BFS, which violates the question's requirements.
- Acknowledge that the solution is correct in logic and time complexity.
- Suggest changing the traversal to BFS.

### `style_issues_submission.py`

#### Submission Summary

The logic is correct, but the code suffers from inefficiencies and style concerns:

```python
def is_connected(graph):
    visited = {}
    for i in range(len(graph)):
        visited[i] = False

    queue = []
    queue.append(0)
    visited[0] = True

    while len(queue) > 0:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if visited[neighbor] == False:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                queue.append(neighbor)

    for node in visited:
        if visited[node] == False:
            return False
    return True
```

The solution:
- Uses a dictionary instead of a boolean list for `visited`.
- Contains verbose conditionals like `== False`.

#### Expected AI Response

- Acknowledge that the implementation is functionally correct.
- Recommend simplifying logic using lists and direct truthy checks (e.g., `if not visited[i]`).
- Suggest replacing `while len(queue) > 0` with `while queue`.
