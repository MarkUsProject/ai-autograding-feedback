## Task: Proving Optimality of the Earliest Finish Time (EFT) Algorithm for Interval Scheduling

---

### Problem Summary

You are given a set of intervals $\mathcal{I} = \{I_1, I_2, \dots, I_n\}$, where each interval $I_i = [s_i, f_i)$ has a start time $s_i$ and finish time $f_i$.

The goal of the **Interval Scheduling Problem** is to select the largest possible subset of mutually non-overlapping intervals.

The proposed greedy algorithm, known as the **Earliest Finish Time (EFT)** algorithm, proceeds as follows:

> Sort the intervals in increasing order of finish time. Iteratively select the first interval that starts after the finish of the last selected one.

### Your Task

Prove that the EFT greedy algorithm always returns an optimal solution. Use a proof by contradiction, induction, or direct argument — but **do not** use an exchange argument. Your proof should be rigorous and clearly structured.

### `submission_incorrect.pdf`

#### Submission Summary

This proof lacks formal structure and relies on circular reasoning:

```latex
The greedy algorithm picks the best interval at each step, so it must be the optimal solution.

It sorts by finish time, and always chooses the earliest one, which is the most efficient. If it was not optimal, that would mean it missed a better interval, but it always picks the best.

Therefore, it is optimal.
```

- No definition of optimality or contradiction.
- Assumes what it is trying to prove.
- Offers no structural or mathematical reasoning.

#### Expected AI Response

- Identify circular logic.
- Point out lack of definitions or contradiction structure.
- Recommend explicitly comparing greedy and optimal solutions.

### `submission_missing_step.pdf`

#### Submission Summary

This submission starts a contradiction argument but skips a critical justification step:

```latex
Let $A$ be the set of intervals chosen by the greedy algorithm. Assume for contradiction that there exists another set $O$ with more non-overlapping intervals.

The greedy algorithm always picks the interval with the earliest finish time. This ensures that we leave the maximum possible room for the rest of the intervals.

So every interval in $A$ finishes before or at the same time as the corresponding interval in $O$. Hence, $A$ should be able to contain at least as many intervals as $O$.

Therefore, the greedy algorithm is optimal.
```

- Assumes a one-to-one correspondence between $A$ and $O$ without justification.
- Fails to show that greedy's early finishes actually allow inclusion of $k$ intervals.
- Contradiction is stated but not completed rigorously.

#### Expected AI Response

- Acknowledge the correct overall structure.
- Highlight the unjustified assumption of alignment between $A$ and $O$.
- Recommend explicitly showing how EFT's earliest-finish choice leads to no worse than optimal.

### `submission_inductive.pdf`

#### Submission Summary

Uses a clean induction argument to show the greedy algorithm always yields an optimal solution:

```latex
Let $A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k\}$ be the set selected by the EFT algorithm.

We prove by induction that $A$ is of maximum size.

\textbf{Base case ($k = 1$):} The first interval finishes earliest among all, and is thus compatible with the most remaining time. No larger compatible subset can start before it finishes.

\textbf{Inductive step:} Assume the algorithm produces an optimal set of size $k-1$.

Let $a_k$ be the $k$-th greedy interval, and suppose an optimal solution $O$ has $k$ non-overlapping intervals.

At step $k$, the greedy choice $a_k$ has the earliest finish time among intervals that don’t overlap with $a_1, \dots, a_{k-1}$. Let $o_k$ be the corresponding $k$-th interval in $O$.

We consider two cases:

- If $o_k$ starts after $a_{k-1}$, then $f(a_k) \le f(o_k)$, so $a_k$ is at least as good as $o_k$.
- If $o_k$ overlaps with $a_{k-1}$, it couldn't be selected anyway.

Thus, $A$ fits $k$ compatible intervals, matching $O$. So $A$ is optimal.
```

- Clearly structured.
- Justifies steps with finish-time comparisons.
- Avoids exchange argument and builds up logically.

#### Expected AI Response

- Recognize the use of induction and structural reasoning.
- Confirm logical correctness and completeness.
- Praise clarity and formality.
