FizzBuzz Function

Write a Python function called fizzbuzz(n) that returns a list of results for the numbers from 1 to n.

For each number from 1 to n:

If the number is divisible by 3, put the string 'Fizz' in the list.
If the number is divisible by 5, put the string 'Buzz' in the list.
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, put the string 'FizzBuzz' in the list.
Otherwise, just put the number itself in the list.

Examples
>>> fizzbuzz(5)
[1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz']
