## Task: Ethics of Using Public Data for Machine Learning

---

### Problem Summary

Answer the following ethics question in a short written response (6–10 sentences):

**Is it ethically acceptable to collect and use publicly available data from social media to train machine learning models without user consent?**

Students should support their answers with clear reasoning, real-world examples, and consideration of ethical frameworks (such as utilitarianism, privacy, consent, or harm). They are encouraged to reflect on the distinction between accessibility and ethical use.

> The goal is to evaluate reasoning, not correctness of any single opinion.

## Submissions

### `excellent_submission.txt`

#### Submission Summary

This student presents a clear and well-reasoned argument, supported by ethical theory and examples:

> It is not ethically acceptable to use social media data without user consent, even if it's public. Public accessibility does not mean people agreed to have their data used for training models, especially in ways they didn’t anticipate. From a deontological perspective, individuals have a right to privacy and informed consent. Even under utilitarianism, the harm from misuse or bias may outweigh the benefits. For instance, facial recognition models trained on scraped images have led to racial profiling. Ethical data use requires not just legality but transparency and accountability. Companies must implement policies that respect digital autonomy.

#### Expected AI Response

- Highlight use of ethical principles (deontology, utilitarianism).
- Point out strong real-world example (facial recognition).
- Note strength in balancing harms and rights.
- Reinforce clarity and structured argument.

### `average_submission.txt`

#### Submission Summary

This student gives a reasonable argument but lacks structure and deep ethical reasoning:

> If the data is already public, I think it’s probably okay to use it. People put stuff online knowing it’s out there. But companies should maybe still tell users they’re using it. It would be better if there was more transparency. I think it’s not a huge issue unless it harms someone. But I also see how it could go wrong. Like, some people wouldn’t want their photos in AI datasets. It depends on what the model is being used for.

#### Expected AI Response

- Acknowledge basic awareness of the issue.
- Recommend referencing ethical principles or clearer justification.
- Suggest better organization and more specific examples.
- Encourage critical evaluation of consequences.

### `weak_submission.txt`

#### Submission Summary

This response misunderstands or oversimplifies the ethical issue:

> If it’s online, it’s free to use. The internet is public so there’s no reason to ask. Companies can do what they want with public info. People should know better than to post things if they don’t want it used. Ethics doesn’t matter if it’s not illegal. Social media is public space so anything goes.

#### Expected AI Response

- Point out failure to distinguish legal from ethical standards.
- Note the lack of ethical reasoning or concern for privacy.
- Recommend reconsidering consent and public vs. private assumptions.
- Suggest basic definitions of ethics and examples of misuse.

### `off_topic_submission.txt`

#### Submission Summary

This response is vague, off-topic, or lacks any critical reasoning:

> Technology is always changing and it’s hard to keep up. People put things online and companies use it. It’s just part of how the internet works. AI is new and exciting and we should embrace it. Social media has changed how we live. Things are more connected now. It’s complicated.

#### Expected AI Response

- Flag the submission as lacking relevance to the ethical question.
- Note absence of argument, position, or ethical framework.
- Recommend re-reading the prompt and focusing on data use/consent.
- Encourage more focused engagement with ethical dimensions.
