It is not ethically acceptable to use social media data without user consent, even if it's public. Public accessibility does not mean people agreed to have their data used for training models, especially in ways they didnâ€™t anticipate. From a deontological perspective, individuals have a right to privacy and informed consent. Even under utilitarianism, the harm from misuse or bias may outweigh the benefits. For instance, facial recognition models trained on scraped images have led to racial profiling. Ethical data use requires not just legality but transparency and accountability. Companies must implement policies that respect digital autonomy.
