Core Requirements a Good Response Should Address
A high-quality answer should address ethical concerns, potential justifications, and the implications of using public data without consent. Here's a breakdown of what to look for:

1. Clear Position (Thesis Statement)
Student should explicitly answer the question: Is it ethically acceptable to collect and use publicly available data from social media to train machine learning models without user consent?

examples:
Yes, it is ethically acceptable under certain conditions

No, it is not ethical without user consent

It depends on the context, but caution is necessary

2. Ethical Justification
does the submission contain some justification for their position that makes logical sense

3. Public vs. Private Data Distinction
Address whether being “publicly available” removes ethical responsibility:

Is accessibility the same as consent?

Does platform policy equate to moral permission?

4. Consideration of Risks/Harms
Identify concerns realistic risks or harms of their position and offers mitigation stratgies

5. Acknowledgment of Opposing Viewpoints
Include reasonable opposing arguments:

“If users post publicly, they should expect the data to be used.”

“Training ML can improve products that benefit users.”

6. Structured, Coherent Writing
Clear introduction, body, and conclusion

Logical flow of ideas with transitions
