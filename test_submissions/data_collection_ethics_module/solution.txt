Core Requirements a Good Response Should Address
A high-quality answer should address ethical concerns, potential justifications, and the implications of using public data without consent. Here's a breakdown of what to look for:

1. Clear Position (Thesis Statement)
Student should explicitly answer the question:

Yes, it is ethically acceptable under certain conditions

No, it is not ethical without user consent

It depends on the context, but caution is necessary

2. Ethical Justification
Reference to ethical frameworks such as but not limited to:

Utilitarianism: Does it maximize benefit for society?

Deontology: Is there a duty to respect privacy?

Informed consent: A core principle in data ethics

Fairness and harm: Could marginalized groups be disproportionately affected?

3. Public vs. Private Data Distinction
Address whether being “publicly available” removes ethical responsibility:

Is accessibility the same as consent?

Does platform policy equate to moral permission?

4. Consideration of Risks/Harms
Identify concerns like:

Privacy invasion

Identity inference or profiling

Data used in ways users never expected

5. Acknowledgment of Opposing Viewpoints
Include reasonable opposing arguments:

“If users post publicly, they should expect the data to be used.”

“Training ML can improve products that benefit users.”

6. Structured, Coherent Writing
Clear introduction, body, and conclusion

Logical flow of ideas with transitions
