# Efficiency Submission Scoring Analysis

## Student Submission Summary

This solution creates the correct visualization but uses an inefficient approach:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Inefficient: Recreating dataframe multiple times
for age in ['18-25', '26-35']:
    data = {
        'Age group': [age, age],
        'Socializing time (hour)': [2.5, 3.0] if age == '18-25' else [1.5, 2.0],
        'Exercising time (hour)': [1.0, 0.5] if age == '18-25' else [1.2, 1.1],
        'Sleep time (hour)': [7.0, 6.5] if age == '18-25' else [8.0, 7.5]
    }
    temp_df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    
# Final inefficient boxplot creation
combined_data = {
    'Age group': ['18-25', '18-25', '26-35', '26-35'],
    'Socializing time (hour)': [2.5, 3.0, 1.5, 2.0],
    'Exercising time (hour)': [1.0, 0.5, 1.2, 1.1],
    'Sleep time (hour)': [7.0, 6.5, 8.0, 7.5]
}
final_df = pd.DataFrame(combined_data)
final_df.boxplot(column=['Socializing time (hour)', 'Exercising time (hour)', 'Sleep time (hour)'], by='Age group')
plt.show()
```

## Issues Identified

1. **Redundant Data Creation**: Creates multiple temporary dataframes unnecessarily
2. **Inefficient Looping**: Uses loop-based approach for simple data structure
3. **Memory Waste**: Temporary dataframes created but not effectively used
4. **Over-Complicated Logic**: Complex conditional logic for simple data setup
5. **Duplicate Data Definition**: Defines same data structure multiple times

## Expected AI Response

The AI should identify and address:

- **Inefficient data handling**: Point out that temporary dataframes are created but not used effectively
- **Unnecessary complexity**: Explain that the loop-based approach adds unnecessary complexity for this simple dataset
- **Direct approach recommendation**: Suggest creating the complete dataset once and using it directly
- **Resource optimization**: Emphasize clean, direct approaches in data analysis workflows
- **Code simplification**: Recommend against unnecessary iteration when data structure is straightforward

## Scoring Rubric

- **Correctness: 95/100** - Creates correct boxplot visualization
- **Style: 70/100** - Readable but overly complex structure
- **Efficiency: 50/100** - Major inefficiencies in data handling
- **Overall Grade: C+ (72%)**

## Learning Objectives

This submission tests the AI's ability to:
- Identify inefficient approaches in data manipulation
- Recognize over-engineering in simple data analysis tasks
- Provide guidance on clean, direct coding practices
- Understand resource optimization in data science workflows
