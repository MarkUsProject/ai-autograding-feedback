# Correct Submission Scoring Analysis

## Student Submission Summary

This implementation correctly fulfills all requirements with good practices:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load the Super Bowl commercials data
sb = pd.read_csv("superbowl_ads.csv", encoding="ISO-8859-1")

# Create histogram with 50 bins for detailed view
fig1 = px.histogram(sb, x="view_count", nbins=50, 
                   title="Super Bowl Commercial View Count Distribution (50 bins)")
fig1.show()

# Create histogram with 25 bins for medium granularity
fig2 = px.histogram(sb, x="view_count", nbins=25,
                   title="Super Bowl Commercial View Count Distribution (25 bins)")
fig2.show()

# Create histogram with 10 bins for broad overview
fig3 = px.histogram(sb, x="view_count", nbins=10,
                   title="Super Bowl Commercial View Count Distribution (10 bins)")
fig3.show()
```

## Strengths Identified

1. **Perfect Requirement Compliance**: Includes histogram with 50 bins as specified
2. **Logical Progression**: Uses varied bin counts (50, 25, 10) for different granularities
3. **Excellent Documentation**: Clear comments explaining purpose of each histogram
4. **Professional Titles**: Descriptive titles that enhance interpretation
5. **Efficient Structure**: Clean, readable code with proper organization

## Expected AI Response

The AI should identify and praise:

- **Requirement fulfillment**: Acknowledge that all specifications are met including the 50-bin requirement
- **Thoughtful bin selection**: Praise the logical progression from detailed (50) to broad (10) views
- **Documentation quality**: Recognize clear comments that explain the analytical purpose
- **Professional presentation**: Commend descriptive titles that aid interpretation
- **Code organization**: Note clean import structure and consistent formatting

## Scoring Rubric

- **Correctness: 100/100** - Perfect implementation of all requirements
- **Style: 95/100** - Excellent code quality and documentation
- **Overall Grade: A+ (98%)**
