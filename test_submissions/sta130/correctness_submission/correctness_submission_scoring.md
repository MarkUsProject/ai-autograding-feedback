# Correctness Submission Scoring Analysis

## Student Submission Summary

This version has major logical errors and fails to meet core requirements:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
sb = pd.read_csv("superbowl_ads.csv", encoding = "ISO-8859-1")
# Create a histogram with about 50 bins
px.histogram(sb, x='view_count', nbins = 30)
```

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Required Histograms**: Creates only ONE histogram instead of the required 3 histograms
2. **Incorrect Bin Count**: Uses 30 bins instead of the specified ~50 bins as mentioned in the comment
3. **Incomplete Task Fulfillment**: Fails to create multiple histograms for distribution comparison
4. **Requirement Violation**: Does not explore different granularities as specified in the assignment
5. **Comment-Code Mismatch**: Comment says "about 50 bins" but code uses 30 bins

## Expected AI Response

The AI should identify and address:

- **Major task incompletion**: Point out that only 1 out of 3 required histograms is created
- **Bin count discrepancy**: Note that both the comment indicates 50 bins but code uses 30, neither meeting the requirement
- **Assignment misunderstanding**: Explain that the task requires creating 3 different histograms to compare distributions at different granularities
- **Specification failure**: Emphasize that one histogram specifically needs approximately 50 bins as required
- **Corrective guidance**: Suggest creating two additional histograms with different bin counts (e.g., 10 and 25) alongside the required 50-bin histogram

## Scoring Rubric

- **Correctness: 25/100** - Major failure to meet core requirements (only 1/3 histograms, wrong bin count)
- **Style: 75/100** - Reasonable formatting but poor commenting accuracy
- **Overall Grade: F (42%)**

## Learning Objectives

This submission tests the AI's ability to:
- Identify major task incompletion and requirement failures
- Recognize discrepancies between comments and actual code implementation
- Explain the importance of following assignment specifications completely
- Understand the purpose behind multi-histogram comparative analysis
- Provide comprehensive guidance for complete task fulfillment
