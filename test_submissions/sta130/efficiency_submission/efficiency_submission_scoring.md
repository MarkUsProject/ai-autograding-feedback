# Efficiency Submission Scoring Analysis

## Student Submission Summary

This solution creates correct histograms but uses inefficient approaches:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

sb = pd.read_csv("superbowl_ads.csv", encoding="ISO-8859-1")

# Inefficient: Reading data multiple times
for i in range(3):
    sb_temp = pd.read_csv("superbowl_ads.csv", encoding="ISO-8859-1")
    if i == 0:
        fig = px.histogram(sb_temp, x="view_count", nbins=50)
    elif i == 1:
        fig = px.histogram(sb_temp, x="view_count", nbins=25)
    else:
        fig = px.histogram(sb_temp, x="view_count", nbins=10)
    fig.show()
```

## Issues Identified

1. **Redundant File Reading**: Loads the CSV file multiple times unnecessarily
2. **Memory Waste**: Creates temporary dataframes in each loop iteration
3. **Performance Impact**: Inefficient I/O operations slow down execution
4. **Poor Loop Design**: Uses unnecessary loop for creating distinct visualizations
5. **Resource Mismanagement**: Doesn't reuse already-loaded data

## Expected AI Response

The AI should identify and address:

- **Inefficient I/O operations**: Point out that the CSV file should be loaded once and reused
- **Unnecessary looping**: Explain that distinct visualizations don't require loops when they're different
- **Resource optimization**: Suggest storing the loaded dataframe and referencing it for each histogram
- **Performance considerations**: Emphasize efficient resource usage in data analysis workflows
- **Code simplification**: Recommend direct approach rather than complex loop structures

## Scoring Rubric

- **Correctness: 95/100** - Creates correct histograms with proper bin counts
- **Style: 70/100** - Readable but inefficient structure
- **Efficiency: 40/100** - Major performance issues with file handling
- **Overall Grade: C (68%)**

## Learning Objectives

This submission tests the AI's ability to:
- Identify performance and efficiency issues in data analysis code
- Understand best practices for file I/O operations
- Recognize when code structure creates unnecessary overhead
- Provide guidance on resource optimization in data science
- Balance correctness with efficiency considerations
